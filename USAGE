Usage
=====

Quickstart:
-----------

Add `sms` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in ``settings.py``:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # apps
        'sms',
    )
    
Get in sync to update the database and install the provided ``Carrier`` fixtures:

    python manage.py syncdb
    
And play with some code:

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
    from sms.models import Carrier, ContentTypePhoneNumber, OutboundMessage
    from sms.util import send_sms

    # get a user
    matt = User.objects.get(username="matt")

    # get matt's cell phone carrier (at&t)
    att = Carrier.objects.get(pk=7)

    # attach a phone number to matt
    matts_phone_number, created = ContentTypePhoneNumber.objects.get_or_create(
        content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(User),
        object_id = matt.pk,
        carrier = att,
        phone_number = "123-123-1234"
    )

    # do stuff (probably very important!!!!) ...

    # send matt an sms
    send_sms(
        msg = "omg im texting from python!",
        from_address = "mattdennewitz@gmail.com",
        recipient_list = [matts_phone_number],
        fail_silently = False
    )
    
How Do I Make This Work?
------------------------

SMS messages are sent with the ``sms.util.send_sms`` function,
which is nearly identical to ``django.core.mail.send_mail``. The key differences are
that message subjects are not accepted and the ``recipient_list`` argument should be
a list of ``ContentTypePhoneNumber`` objects.

``django-sms`` provides two three models for users to work with:

  1. ``Carrier``, which represents the email-to-sms gateway provided by service providers. 61 carriers
     are provided for you in the ``fixtures``, which *should* cover most everyone's needs.
     
  2. ``ContentTypePhoneNumber``, which provides:
    
    * phone number storage
    * description of phone number - *optional*, meant for 'home' or 'work'
    * 'primary phone number' definition - *optional*, useful if you use this for contact storage
    
    ``ContentTypePhoneNumber`` also has a custom manager, ``PhoneNumberManager``, which allows
    for ``User`` lookups via ``ContentTypePhoneNumber.objects.get_for_user(user_obj)``. This manager
    will probably be fleshed out later, but thats it for now.

  3. ``OutboundMessage``, which acts as a message log. When a message is sent with ``sms.util.send_sms``,
     the ``Carrier``, ``ContentTypePhoneNumber`` and dispatch time are logged. This is for pulling usage
     information for both ``Carrier``s and ``ContentTypePhoneNumber``s. 
     
     To pull data from the ``OutboundMessage`` logs, check out ``OutboundMessageManager``. It has two helpers
     now, but will also probably be expanded in the future:
     
     * ``most_popular_carriers``, which pulls the most popular carriers in a given (*optional*) date range
     * ``most_contacted_numbers``, which pulls the most popular phone numbers is a given (*optional*) date range
     
     See their documentation for more.

What's Coming
-------------

* Signals. Maybe.
* Forms, if people request such. Seems like a ``ModelForm`` for the ``Carrier``s should suffice for now.
* Requests?
     
Words of Advice
---------------

1. The data used in the fixtures was culled from Wikipedia. I didn't ask first, so I'm sorry for any toes
  I may have stepped on.

2. Phone service providers are liable to shut off these services or make any changes to format, rate limit, etc.
  on a whim. If you encounter any changes, report them and we'll see what can happen.
  
3. Don't spam your users! Not that you would ...
